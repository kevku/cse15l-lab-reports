To compare the codes, we used `vim diff` after a bash loop to see what results were different from our implementation to their implementation.  
The highlighted parts made it easy to identify which files were producing the different outputs.  
The highlights made it easy to manually check which files were having issues.  

[One of the tests that both code differed](https://github.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser/blob/main/test-files/194.md)  

According to Common Mark, this should be the correct output
